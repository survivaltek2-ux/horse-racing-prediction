- [x] Removed development server files and scripts
- [x] Cleaned up development-specific configurations

### 2. Test and Debug File Cleanup
- [x] Removed all test files (test_*.py)
- [x] Removed debug scripts and utilities
- [x] Removed development deployment scripts
- [x] Cleaned up debug print statements from code

### 3. Configuration Updates
- [x] Updated .env.example with production settings
- [x] Created .env.production with secure defaults
- [x] Updated logging configuration for production
- [x] Removed debug mode from predictor utilities
- [x] Updated static HTML files to use relative URLs

### 4. Production Files Ready
- [x] Docker production configuration (docker-compose.production.yml)
- [x] Production deployment script (deploy.sh)
- [x] Nginx configuration for production
- [x] Requirements.txt with all dependencies
- [x] Production environment variables template

## üîß Pre-Deployment Setup Required

### Environment Variables
Before deploying, ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
# Required for production
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
POSTGRES_DB=hrp_database
POSTGRES_USER=hrp_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secure-password-here

# API Keys (if using external APIs)
ODDS_API_API_KEY=your-api-key
RAPID_API_API_KEY=your-api-key
THERACINGAPI_USERNAME=your-username
THERACINGAPI_PASSWORD=your-password

# SSL Configuration
SSL_CERT_PATH=/etc/nginx/ssl/cert.pem
SSL_KEY_PATH=/etc/nginx/ssl/key.pem
```

### SSL Certificates
- [ ] Obtain SSL certificates for HTTPS
- [ ] Place certificates in the ssl/ directory
- [ ] Update nginx configuration with correct paths

### Database Setup
- [ ] Set up production PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Configure database connection string
- [ ] Run database migrations

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Copy production environment file
cp .env.production .env

# Build and start production containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Check container status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f
```

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Run the deployment script
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Database connection successful
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Static files served properly
- [ ] SSL certificates working
- [ ] Logs show no critical errors

### Security Verification
- [ ] Debug mode disabled
- [ ] Secure headers configured
- [ ] Database credentials secured
- [ ] API keys properly configured
- [ ] File permissions set correctly

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Application responds within acceptable time
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Static files cached properly
- [ ] Memory usage within limits

## üìã Monitoring Setup

### Recommended Monitoring
- [ ] Set up application monitoring (e.g., New Relic, DataDog)
- [ ] Configure log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack)
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerting for critical errors

### Backup Strategy
- [ ] Database backup schedule configured
- [ ] Application data backup plan
- [ ] Backup restoration tested

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Access Control
- [ ] Admin user created with strong password
- [ ] User registration configured appropriately
- [ ] API access controls in place

### Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted
- [ ] Secure communication (HTTPS)
- [ ] Input validation enabled
- [ ] SQL injection protection active

## üìû Support Information

### Documentation
- See DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed deployment instructions
- See SECURITY.md for security guidelines
- See README.md for application overview

### Troubleshooting
- Check application logs in logs/ directory
- Review Docker container logs
- Verify environment variable configuration
- Check database connectivity
